# Alarm Sound File

You need to add an alarm sound file to make the alarm play properly.

## Options:

1. **Download a free alarm sound**:
   - Search for "alarm sound mp3 free"
   - Download and place in `assets/alarm-sound.mp3`

2. **Use the built-in notification sound**:
   - The app will fallback to the default notification sound
   - This will work but won't be as loud or persistent

3. **Create your own alarm sound**:
   - Use any audio editing software to create a loud, repeating alarm
   - Save as MP3 format in the assets folder

## Current Status:
- Colon input is fixed (cannot be removed)
- Notification channels are configured
- Audio playback is set up
- Fallback to default sound if custom sound not found

The app will work with the default notification sound for now.
